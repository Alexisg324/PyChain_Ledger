## PyChain Ledger 

This app was built as a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface (using streamlit). This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (i.e. transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify fraudulant activity.  

## Required Technologies

Python 3.10.1
Streamlit
pandas
hashlib

## Installation Guide

Installing Python (MacOS):

Command + Space Enter Terminal in search bar and press enter Terminal should open Open Homebrew Installation website in browser (https://brew.sh/) Copy installation code at the bottom of the page Copy shown link into terminal Once Homebrew is installed, install Python Open Terminal Enter "brew install python3" into the CLI to install Python Installing Anaconda with Python (MacOS): Enter "conda create -n dev python=3.7 anaconda" into the command line terminal Return and type Y when prompted Open environment by entering "conda activate dev" Enable terminal commands through conda

Clone local Repo: git clone https://github.com/Alexisg324/PyChain_Ledger

## Usage

In order for the user to use this application, they must first clone the repo (by typing, git clone ___ to their desktop.  Next, the user must open the terminal (MAC OS) and in the Comman-line in the folder, type - "streanlit run pychain.py". 

Below is an image of the websute streamlit browser that will automatically pop up on your web in a new tab.

The user will enter in the information of sender to reciever, and the amount they wish to send.  
The Py ledger will then verify and validate the transaction.

## License
license() A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became Zope Corporation. In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for the Open Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python Hit Return for more, or q (and Return) to quit: releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.

Release Derived Year Owner GPL- from compatible? (1)

0.9.0 thru 1.2 1991-1995 CWI yes 1.3 thru 1.5.2 1.2 1995-1999 CNRI yes 1.6 1.5.2 2000 CNRI no 2.0 1.6 2000 BeOpen.com no 1.6.1 1.6 2001 CNRI yes (2) 2.1 2.0+1.6.1 2001 PSF no 2.0.1 2.0+1.6.1 2001 PSF yes 2.1.1 2.1+2.0.1 2001 PSF yes 2.1.2 2.1.1 2002 PSF yes 2.1.3 2.1.2 2002 PSF yes 2.2 and above 2.1.1 2001-now PSF yes Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under the GPL. All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source. The Hit Return for more, or q (and Return) to quit: GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, because its license has a choice of law clause. According to CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.
